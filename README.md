# Selenium Automation Framework – Demo Project

## Overview
This is a **junior-level Selenium automation framework** built using Java and TestNG.  
The goal is to demonstrate understanding of automation basics, Page Object Model, waits, and clean test structure.

## Why This Project
This project was created as a learning and demonstration framework for junior QA and automation roles.
It focuses on writing stable, readable, and maintainable Selenium tests rather than advanced tooling.

## What I Learned
- Setting up Selenium with Maven and TestNG
- Implementing Page Object Model
- Using explicit waits to reduce flaky tests
- Structuring automation code for maintainability
- Using Git and GitHub for version control

## Tech Stack
- Java
- Selenium WebDriver
- TestNG
- Maven
- Page Object Model (POM)
- GitHub

## Application Under Test
https://www.saucedemo.com/

## Test Scenarios
- Valid login
- Navigation to inventory page

## Project Structure
- base → WebDriver setup
- pages → Page Object classes
- tests → TestNG test cases

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open in Eclipse
3. Run test classes as TestNG tests
